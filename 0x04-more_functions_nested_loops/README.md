Task 0: A function that checks for uppercase character,using prototye(int _isupper(int c)) that returns 1 if uppercase otherwise 0.

Task 1: A function that checks for a digit(0 through 9), using prototype(int _isdigit(int c)) that returns 1 if its a digit otherwise 0.

Task 2: A function that multiplies two integers using prototype(int mul(int a, int b)).

Task 3: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line using prototype(void print_numbers(void)) and _putchar twice.

Task 4: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 with the exception of 2 and 4, followed by a new line using prototype(void print_most_numbers(void)) and _putchar twice.

Task 5: A function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14, followed by anew line using prototype(void more_numbers(void)) and _putchar three times.

Task 6: A function that draws a straight line in the terminal using prototype(void print_line(int n)) and using  only _putchar.

Task 7: A function that drwas a diagonal line in the terminal using prototype(void print_diagonal(int n)) and using only _putchar.

Task 8: A function that prints a square, followed by a new line using prototype(void print_square(int size) using only _putchar.

Task 9: This was an interview question that; It is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz separated by a new space.

Task 10: A function that prints a triangle followed by a new line using only _putchar and prototype(void print_triangle(int size)).

Task 11: A program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

Task 12: A function that prints an intege using only _putchar and prototype(void print_number(int n)).
